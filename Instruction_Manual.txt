Workplace Description 
The role of the player is mainly focused around complications and stress, and trying to figure out a way to fix any problems that arise from these two things. The stress in this case comes in the form of various events that hinder your ability to complete a task. The workplace we chose is heavily interlinked with mostly positive feedback. As a teacher, success means having the class as a whole succeed. When this happens, it becomes easier for a teacher to replicate that success, and continue to help their classes succeed for years to come.
One of the important choices in this workplace is deciding on which student needs the most help, and how that can be given in the shortest amount of time to start helping other students. One pillar we used in our game was the idea of unexpected events throwing everything off, making it harder to solve a problem. These events come in the form of things such as a sudden flood, or a sudden fire. A second pillar can be found in the narratives that are being built through improvising solutions. The necessity of solving a problem in a short amount of time can create very interesting “solutions” to the problem, which increases the game’s element of fun.
